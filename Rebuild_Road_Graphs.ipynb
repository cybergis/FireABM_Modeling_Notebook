Road network information are from OpenStreetMap, so road network data can be edited by OpenStreetMap users at any time. Sta_Rosa_2000.pkl and Sta_Rosa_8000.pkl are created using code in this notebook (Rebuild_Road_Graphs). If you run this notebook, you will overwrite the existing road network files with new ones. For replicability sake, Sta_Rosa_2000_orig.pkl and Sta_Rosa_8000_orig.pkl were the road network files used in the manuscript experiments. Because the base Open Street Map data has changed since the experiments were preformed, these files will be different than ones generated with the Rebuild_Road_Graphs code."
