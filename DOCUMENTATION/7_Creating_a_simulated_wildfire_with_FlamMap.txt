### Creating a simulated wildfire with FlamMap

Any shapefile of fire perimeters can be used as an input for modeling fire spread provided it has a column called 'SimTime' that contains a temporal key, where each polygon associated with the fire perimeter at the same time step has the same 'SimTime' value.

For this manuscript, fire perimeters were created using the FARSITE tutorial included in the FlamMap help documentation at this website, http://flammaphelp.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. The resulting perimeters were then moved and rotated to fit the study area and do not represent realistic wildfire spread for Santa Rosa. As the authenticity of the wildfire spread itself is not crucial to this particular study, using this wildfire files show the model's capacity to work with fire results from this program.

To create a simple fire spread simulation in FlamMap, you will need a Landscape file (.lcp), a weather stream file (.wxs), and a shapefile containing the initial ignition point or area. You can obtain a landscape file for your study area from https://www.landfire.gov/viewer/viewer.html. You will also need a fuel moisture file, but you can create one using within the FlamMap software. One source for weather stream files is https://fam.nwcg.gov/fam-web/kcfast/html/wxhmenu.htm. The file type .fw13 will need to be converted to a .wxs in order to be used with FARSITE. This conversion can be done using FireFamily Plus software following this tutorial: https://iftdss.firenet.gov/firenetHelp/help/pageHelp/content/20-models/classifiedwthr/aboutwxslfb.htm.

Once you have all these files, open the landscape file in FlamMap. Right click 'Runs' under 'Analysis Areas' and select 'New Farsite Run'. 

First load or create your fuel moisture file by clicking the Fuel Moisture File button. Select 'Generate Gridded Winds From Weather Inputs' to set up wind information. Upload your weather stream in the 'Fuel Moisture Settings' section and set the burn periods. In the 'Model Settings' tab, upload the initial ignition shapefile and set setting parameters. Set burn periods. Finally select which outputs you would like (make sure you select 'Perimeters' in order use the output in the fire evacuation simulation. Finally select 'Apply' and 'Launch Farsite' to run the fire spread simulation. You can export the fire perimeters to use in the evacuation model.
