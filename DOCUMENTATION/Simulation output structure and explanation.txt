### Simulation output structure and explanation

Each simulation run produces three files, a file of general information, a file of vehicle trajectories, and an output video, which are stored in subfolders entitled 'files', 'trajs', and 'videos' respectively (the experiment number added to the front of each folder to help keep track of runs). More information on each of the files is included below.

1. Run information

This file contains general information about the run. Columns are:
	- Exp_no: 
		the experiment number
	- NB_no: 
		the notebook number (can be used to indicate which notebook simulation is run from if run from multiple notebooks for smaller runs)
	- Treat_no: 
		flag that can help differentiate runs, can be set per strategy
	- Rep_no:
		also flag that can help differentiate runs
	- Seed: 
		this value determines the initial vehicle distribution - two runs with the same parameters and the same seeds will be identical
	- Elpsd_time_TS: 
		this is the number of time steps taken for each vehicle to clear the evacuation zone
	- Total_cars: 
		the total number of vehicles in the simulation
	- Stuck_cars: 
		the number of cars that were not able to navigate out of the evacuation zone due to blocked roads
	- Num_rds_in_bbox: 
		the total number of road segments (edges) within the evacuation zone
	- veh_by_strat: 
		how many vehicles are assigned to each strategy used - is helpful for mixed simulations where different subsets of vehicles use different driving strategies
	- Finish_time: 
		time stamp when the simulation completed
	- Treat_desc: 
		short text tag set at the beginning of the simulation run, typically describes the portion of vehicles using each driving strategy
	- Exp_desc: 
		short text tag set at the beginning of the simulation run, typically describes the overall aim of the simulation run
	- RG_file:
		which road graph file was used
	- Veh_stat_by_time:
		status of all vehicles at a set timestamp (typically 25 time steps) - shows the time step (ts), number of cleared vehicles, number of stick vehicles, and the percent of total vehicles that have cleared
	- Cong_by_time:
		list of dictionaries, each list item contains a dictionary with the timestep (ts), the total number of vehicles on the road at the end of the timestep, and the average number of vehicles per roads containing at least one vehicle
		
	- Veh_by_edge:
		dictionary where the keys are road edge IDs. For each edge that has at least one vehicle during the simulation, dictionary values are a list where for each list item contains the timestep, number of vehicles on the road segment, and the number of vehicles decided by the road segment length 

	- Init_Veh_coords:
		initial coordinate positions of each vehicle

2. Vehicle trajectories
	
This file contains trajectories for each vehicle in a simulation run, one trajectory per row. Each row starts with the vehicle ID number and then a list. Each item in the list is an edge key and the time stamp that the edge was entered. The last item in the list is a notation of the vehicle's final status, typical 'GOAL' with the goal node and the time stamp of arrival, but also could be 'STUCK' if all paths between a vehicle and the exits become blocked.

3. Video

This file contains a video of the simulation. Vehicles are represented by colored points and the evacuation zone is represented by a red line.
