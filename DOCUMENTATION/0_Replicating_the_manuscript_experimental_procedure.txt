### Replicating the manuscript experimental procedure

Here are the steps needed to replicate the experimental procedure:

1. Gather provided input files
	- fire_input/santa_rosa_fire.shp (and associated files)
		- fire perimeters used in manuscript experiment
	- households/Santa_Rosa_tracts_hh.shp (and associated files)
		- households used to place vehicles according to population distribution

2. Construct road graphs using the 'Rebuild_Road_Graphs' Jupyter notebook
	- uses fire perimeters and households files
	- creates road graphs used in the simulation
	- output: Sta_Rosa_2000.pkl and Sta_Rosa_8000.pkl
		- Sta_Rosa_2000.pkl is smaller and can be used for testing
		- Sta_Rosa_8000.pkl is used for manuscript experiments

3. Run simulations on HPC 
	- create virtual conda environment (see "Creating a virtual environment for Osmnx" help documentation)
	- on HPC, adjust jobscript.sh for your particular setup (input email, path to data folder) and a particular driving strategy, and output folders (you can also adjust the seed increments in both run_jobs.sh and jobscript.sh). To run the simulation, submit run_jobs.sh to the scheduler
	- occasionally seeds fail to successfully complete, run more iterations than required to ensure enough can be used (only seeds that successfully run for each driving strategy are kept)

4. Gather result data on HPC
	- run check_seeds.py to check if there enough successful seeds
	- run collect_results_by_strat.py to combine all results from one strategy to one file
	- run combine_results.py to combine results from collect_results_by_strat.py into one file that contains results from all strategies
	- note, simulation results used in the manuscript can be found in combined_rslts_8_13.txt

5. Create output figures and graphs using the 'Graph_Results_Final' Jupyter notebook
	- input: combined simulation results (combined_rslts_8_13.txt)
