### Which core script version to use: FireABM_opt.py or FireABM_opt_Keel.py

These scripts are built for 2 different versions of the Osmnx package. FireABM_opt.py corresponds to 0.11.4, which is currently included in the CyberGISX Python3 kernel. FireABM_opt_Keel.py has been slightly modified to run batch jobs on Virtual Roger (Keeling), which is set up to use a virtual environment containing Osmnx version 0.15.1.

The following minor changes were made to calls to the ox.project_geometry and ox.plot_graph functions in order for the code to run with Osmnx 0.15.1. 

1. ox.project_geometry
In version 0.15.1 this function is called by ox.projection.project_geometry.

2. ox.plot_graph "fig_height"
"fig_height" is no longer an argument for the plot_graph function. It has been replaced by "figsize". In 0.15.1, uses of "fig_height" were replaced by "figsize" and the width was calculated as ~ 1.2 * the figure hight.

3. ox.plot_graph "margin"
"margin" is no longer a supported argument. This argument was removed for use with 0.15.1.
