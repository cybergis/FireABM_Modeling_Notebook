### Simulation run parameters

The simulation needs to be called twice, once to set up the simulation by calling the __init__ function, and once to actually run the simulation. The code base supports several different types of simulation runs, so not all parameters that can be passed to the simulation are used in the accompanying manuscript experiment runs. An explanation of the parameters used for manuscript experiments follows. Values used for experiments are in parentheses as appropriate.

NetABM __init__ input parameters:
	- road_graph: the input Osmnx road graph (Sta_Rosa_8000.pkl)
	- number of vehicles: the total number of vehicles used in the simulation run (800)
	- bbox: the bounding box of the evacuation zone, lbbox is created by the create_bboxes function with the following buffer [2.1, 4.5, 3, 3] (lbbox)
	- fire_perim: shapefile of fire perimeters (santa_rosa_fire.shp)
	- fire_ignit_time: 'SimTime' value for the first perimeter used in the simulation, can be adjusted to start with a later perimeter, 60 is used because is the first output fire perimeter (60)
	- fire_des_ts_sec: translates intervals between fire times to seconds, used to speed up or slow down a fire spread from the input shapefile, for these experiments 100 is used, so that the fire expands every 100 timesteps (seconds) (100)
	- reset_interval: flag used to indicate the fire time has been translated (True)
	- placement_prob: value name containing the placement probabilities per initial vehicle placements
	- init_strategies: dictionary indicating which driving strategies are used and the percentage of vehicles that should be assigned to each strategy (each driving strategy depending on the simulation, placement prob is 1.0)


NetABM run input parameters:
	- save_args: used to create simulation animation, contains fig, ax created by the setup_sim function, the result file name, the video file name, the folder name for storing the results, i and j which can be used to keep track of iterating through seeds and driving strategies, the seed used, the short tag describing the treatment, the short text describing the experiment, the experiment number and notebook number, and which road graph file is used. More detailed on these can be found in the 'Simulation output structure and explaination' help document
	- mutate_rate: ignored if a fire shapefile is given, if no fire shapefile it is the rate at which road segments will randomly become blocked at an update interval
	- update interval: used for to determine how often the mutate rate will check to close roads
